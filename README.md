Simple C++ procedure to convert any String or Command to an enumerated int value 

I program micro controllers and develop sometimes procedures for testing on Visual studio x86
Recently I needed a simple procedure to convert any charter patern to a value. I saw that I wasn't 
the only one with this problem and since githup has helped me a lot I thought let me do something 
for those who need a solution to convert character pattern to a integers.

It seems that there is a what to convert enumerated identifiers to its enumerated values but I couldn't 
completely understand it. Any one who has more simple ways to solve this string int problem let me know.
