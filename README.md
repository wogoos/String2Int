Simple C++ procedure to convert any String or Command to an enumerated int value 

I program micro controllers and develop sometimes procedures for testing on Visual studio x86
Recently I needed a simple procedure to convert any charter patern to a value. I saw that I wasn't 
the only one with this problem and since githup has helped me a lot I thought let me do something 
for those who need a solution to convert character pattern to a integers.

It seems that there is an other method to convert strings to integers based on enumerated types and 
their identifiers. hw that sis done is not clear to me.Any one who has a more simple ways to solve this string2int problem let me know.
